This theme is based on a _Jekyll_ theme with the same name.

### Setting

Custom settings are available in the `.\lot\content\contrast\state.php` file.

 - To hide the site header, set the `skin.header` state value to `false`.
 - To hide the site navigation, set the `skin.nav` state value to `false`.
 - To hide the site links, set the `skin.links` state value to `false`.
 - Limit the maximum links displayed in site navigation by setting the `skin.nav` state value as numbers to describe the limit.
 - Set your custom links URL in the `skin.links` state. There are `envelope` and `github` item available.
 - To enable dark mode, set the `skin.dark` state to `true`.
 - There are three custom `skin.style` available: `default`, `contrast` and `minimal`.

### Embedded Content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from _YouTube_. To scale the video to full width use the `<div class="embed"></div>` wrapper around the iframe. Use `<div class="large"></div>` wrapper to increase the width of an image or iframe.
